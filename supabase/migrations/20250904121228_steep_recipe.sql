# Fix Team Collaboration Policies

This migration fixes the RLS policies to enable proper team collaboration
instead of isolating users from each other.

## Changes
1. **Drop user-scoped policies** - These were breaking team collaboration
2. **Create company-scoped policies** - Team members can see shared data
3. **Focus on prep lists** - Ensure they work properly for teams
4. **Maintain security** - Still prevent cross-company data access

## Security Model
- Users can see data from their company
- Prep lists, events, recipes are shared within the company
- Cross-company access is still prevented
